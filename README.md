# A Bayesian Framework to Predict and Evaluate Ride Quality

## Overview 
This study proposes a Bayesian framework to identify the key variables influencing ride quality of a planter. 
A robust predictive model is developed that employes Bayesian inference to estimate ride quality with reasonable accuracy and provides highly interpretable results with probability distributions.
